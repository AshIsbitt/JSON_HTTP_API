# HTTP Protocol, JSON and API's :taco:

This class will first recap how the internet actually works.

We will look at GET request and POST request. 

Once we understand the difference we will look at what is an API.

Then we will call API, using GET and POST request and get back JSON. 

JSON! We will also look at what is JSON? 

## HTTP GET and POST 

ADD picture here

GET and POST are both request.
#### GET
Has a user with path + arguments. Also takes metadata and headers. 

#### POST
Has all of the above + JSON or XML

## JSON 
JSON is basically a dictionary in JS (javascript =! java)
Javascrit Object Notation

## What is an API's 
Application Programing Interface
... I think it should be AN interface for PROGRAMS to talk to OTHER programs.

Where an old rotating telephone thing where you select the number is an good for humans it  is not appropriate for machines!

API is the right interface for SERVERS to talk to SERVERS.

Basically it exposes a service in a standardized way. USING JSON!

JSON is basically a dictionary in JS (javascript =! java)

Examples of application: 
- get access to a database / live data (postcodes.io, tfl)
- get access to a service (twillio, google image recognition)
- and many others

## CALLING API with GET

## CALLIN API with POST + JSON 

## Interperting JSON into a dictionary (so we can use is)

## Creating a JSON (from a dictionary or a string)


## Status code 

200's - GOOD
300's - Authethication mission
400's - Not found (frontend error, your path is wrong)
